# CPM Calculator

This is a simple web app that helps to calculate the _Cents per Mile_ (CPM) value of an award flight redemption.

This calculator aims to include various opportunity costs to generate a more accurate and realistic CPM value, including miles transfer fees from credit card partners, as well as opportunity costs from miles accrual from purchasing a revenue flight. Additionally, the calculator comes with built-in currency conversion in case of calculation across multiple currencies.

This web app was created using Svelte + Vite + Tailwind CSS.
